## How to Use This Repository

### 1. View the Report  
The [REPORT.md](./REPORT.md) file contains detailed answers to theoretical questions, ethical reflections, and summaries of the practical tasks.

### 2. Access Notebooks  
All code implementations are in the `notebooks` folder and available on Google Colab for easy execution:  

- **Task 1 - AI-Powered Code Completion:**  
[Open Task 1 Notebook](YOUR_COLAB_LINK_HERE)

- **Task 2 - Automated Testing with AI:**  
[Open Task 2 Notebook](YOUR_COLAB_LINK_HERE)

- **Task 3 - Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation:**  
[Open Task 3 Notebook](YOUR_COLAB_LINK_HERE)

> *Note:* If you want to run the notebooks locally, you will need Python 3.x and necessary libraries installed (`scikit-learn`, `selenium`, `tensorflow`, etc.).
